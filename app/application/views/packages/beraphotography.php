        	<h3>Day1</h3>
        	<p>You will land in Udaipur, lunch or late lunch and drive to Bera - 3 hours followed by bonfire and barbecue dinner.</p>
        	<h3>Day2</h3>
        	<p>The day will begin with morning safari to the hills around Bera village. Most of the hills are within 5 to 10 kilometres radius and accessible in open jeeps. Tea/coffee/water will be carried along and after a morning safari, breakfast will be served at the resort.
		<br><br>
		There is an option to extend the safari and visit Jawai reservoir which is also a Crocodile sanctuary and in winters one finds 14 to 16 footer crocs basking in the sun on the rocks of Jawai. Many migratory birds are also present in the winter months like Greater Flamingoes, Demoiselle Cranes and several others.
        	<br><br>
		Lunch is served at the resort and one can purchase alcohol locally or from the resort. One is allowed to carry their own liquor as well. Snacks can be made for you while one is enjoying their drinks.
		<br><br>
		The property has lot of foliage and trees and several resident and small migratory birds can be seen and photographed.
		<br><br>
		The evening safari will again be at the familiar hills and when one gets information of sightings, we also move to those hills in case there is no sighting where we are positioned. 
		<br><br>
		Tea/coffee/water will be carried along for the safari.
		<br><br>
		When one is back from the safari, the guests will get hot towels and a thirst quencher. After one is freshened up, there will be an evening wildlife movie or a movie about the dayâ€™s sighting. While the movie is being played, one can get refreshments also.
		<br><br>
		This is followed by open area dinner with bon fire to sit around.
